Valine was born in August 7, 2017. It's a fast, simple & efficient Leancloud based no back end comment system.

Theoretically, but not limited to static blog. [Hexo](/en/hexo.md), [Jekyll](/em/jekyll.md), [Typecho](http://typecho.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and other blog programs are currently using Valine.

## Features
